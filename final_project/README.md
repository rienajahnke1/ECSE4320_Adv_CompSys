# FINAL PROJECT: Memory Driver Optimization

For my final project, I wanted to learn more about the Linux kernel while implementing memory optimization techniques learned in class. To do this, I designed an experiment that will run various test files against various memory drivers that I have created. Through this, I will show which data sizes are optimal to which memory drivers. I have always found the bridging of hardware and software very intresting and am exited to work withen the Linux kernel!
