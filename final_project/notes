with file system export

notes:

i wrote kernel memory buffer
practical application:
	someone who writes code in userspace needs to interact with hardware
	sysfs entries
	
	only way to interact with hardware is through the kernel
	
proc to connect
when doing that, user space has no concept of bv memory is protect
kernel does in pages (mmu) each page is 4kb (4096)
