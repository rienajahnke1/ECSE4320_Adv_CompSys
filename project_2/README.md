# Course Project #2: Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

In this design project, I will use C/C++ moduals to carry out high speed matrix-matrix multiplication by explicitly utilizing multiple threads, x86 SIMD instructions and techniques to minimize cache miss rate via restructuring data access patterns.
